Write a script which accepts 3 names as arguments and creates files using these names. The script should list the directory contents afterwards.


SCRIPT:


#Creating files using names accepted as parameters

#!/bin/bash

# Check if 3 arguments were provided
if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
echo "Usage: $0 name1 name2 name3"
exit 1
fi

# Loop through the arguments and create files
for arg in "$@"
do
touch "${arg}.txt"
done

# List the content in directory
ls -l
