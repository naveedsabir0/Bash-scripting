Develop an arithmetic calculator that will accept two numbers and calculate the solutions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Display results to user.

**challenge task

Research the correct syntax for the Selection Programming constructs in bash.

Enhance your program by allowing the user to choose which arithmetic operation they would like to do.
