Write a script to create a file every time enter is pressed.
The script should stop when q is pressed.
Append the file name by 1 every time a file is create as follows: file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt
Every time a file is created it should show the list of files in the directory.

When the script starts it should clear the screen



SCRIPT:

#File creator
#!/bin/bash

# Clear the screen
clear

# Initialize the file counter
count=1

# Loop until the user presses 'q'
while true; do
# Prompt the user to press enter to create a file, or press 'q' to quit
read -p "Press enter to create a file, or press 'q' to quit: " input

# Check if the user pressed 'q'
if [[ "$input" == "q" ]]; then
break # Exit the loop if press 'q'
fi

# Generate the file name and create the file
filename="file$count.txt"
touch $filename

# Increment the file counter
((count++))

# Display the list of files in the directory
echo "List of files in chosen directory:"
ls
done
