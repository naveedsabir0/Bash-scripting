Develop an arithmetic calculator that will accept two numbers and calculate the solutions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Display results to user using 3 decimal places

Use Selection Programming constructs in bash to enhance your program by allowing the user to choose which arithmetic operation they would like to do.
